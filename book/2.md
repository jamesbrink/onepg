Hello, dear reader.
It appears you would like to learn how to program a computer.
To do this, a great first step is to get a website up and running.
This is not very hard and you can do it very quickly.
Let's get started by using [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com) to buy a domain and a website like this one.
Once you get a domain and some of their sick as hell shared hosting, you should wait until going to that domain you bought shows a parked page.
Once this happens, the magic can begin.
